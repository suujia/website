Hello, I'm Susie Chen! I grew up in Vancouver, moved to SF Bay Area to work at Facebook, and now I am just bouncing around different cities or spending my time in NYC. I love working on creative projects including building apps, painting, writing, and making music! I graduated from University of British Columbia in Cognitive Systems, which is just a bunch of psychology and computer science classes. Feel free to reach out to chat or collaborate.

Get to know me by seeing [what I read](https://www.goodreads.com/soosiesays), hearing [me sing](https://www.tiktok.com/@susiechen/video/6882554425118903558), or reading [what I tweet](https://twitter.com/soosiesays).
