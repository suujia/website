I’ve struggled for it for a while. Here are a few things that have helped me the most over the years.

1. Have a weekly Kanban board for the most important tasks for the week. You only work on tasks that matter in the long run, that move the needle, that propel you towards your dreams. Pre-requisite: [Long Term Planning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5paYI2nCarc). This video is the planning system I use: setting a 10 year vision, breaking it down what I have to do every year, breaking it down further quarter by quarter, then by month, by week, then finally I know exactly what I have to do every single day. As long as I get my tasks completed in the granular scale, I know I am headed in the right direction. Of course, a lot of my aspirations are creative so some of the goals are just habits like: "write an hour a day". The future is hard to predict as well, so the granular can be planned closer to the period, the goal of this is to always be headed in the right direction.
2. Determine 1-3 most important tasks for the day. Feel accomplished and decrease in stress after finishing these. Not getting an important tasks done in a day causes regret, negative self talk, anxiety, etc.
3. On cold starts: figure out what is the first 5 minutes of a task. Tell yourself that you will only do that, then allowed to determine whether you’d like to continue or switch to something else. It can even be the act of setting up your space or desktop for the work you are going to do. This un-intimidating request eliminates one of the biggest problems: difficulty starting then putting things off. The same concept runs true for procrastination: “just 5 more minutes of YouTube” or “I’ll start tomorrow”.  We never tell ourselves: “I will never write my book”.
4. Reward yourself after hard work: it could be relaxation, fun activity, material goods, delicious meal, etc. Make sure the reward comes after the work. Pushing yourself too hard for too long will lead to [burnout](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery.htm). In the long term, everyone is motivated by different things, figure out what it is that motivates you. Money, other people, ego, curiosity, mission/purpose, competition, fame, power, mastery, fears, etc are all powerful and common motivators.
5. Break the procrastination habit cycle. Talk to yourself like you would an employee, not a slave: motivating, kind, and fair. Here is the sequence of events that occurs with procrastination and without. Break the cycle and start being kinder to yourself.
