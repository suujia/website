I’ve experimented with a lot of systems to bring out the most work and creativity in me for the past few years. Along with researching a lot on this topic. This is the list of systems that work the best for me.

**1. Prioritize Daily 3:** Determine 1-3 most important tasks for the day. Feel accomplished and decrease in stress after finishing these. Not getting an important tasks done in a day causes regret, negative self talk, anxiety, etc.

**2. On cold starts:** figure out what is the first 5 minutes of a task. Tell yourself that you will only do that, then allowed to determine whether you’d like to continue or switch to something else. It can even be the act of setting up your space or desktop for the work you are going to do. This un-intimidating request eliminates one of the biggest problems: difficulty starting then putting things off. The same concept runs true for procrastination: “just 5 more minutes of YouTube” or “I’ll start tomorrow”. We never tell ourselves: “I will never write my book”.

**3. Reward yourself:** after hard work: it could be relaxation, fun activity, material goods, delicious meal, etc. Incentivizes working on it. Make sure the reward comes after the work. Pushing yourself too hard for too long will lead to [burnout](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery.htm). In the long term, everyone is motivated by different things, figure out what it is that motivates you. Money, other people, ego, curiosity, mission/purpose, competition, fame, power, mastery, fears, etc are all powerful and common motivators. If it is a team, celebrate or praise milestones and hardwork often, it makes people feel good. Positive reinforcement is one of the most effective and cheapest way to encourage behavior: it makes people feel good and it keeps people coming back because the previous time was a positive experience. I find that pushing myself past my limit creates not only burnout, but an extremely negative feeling associated with whatever I was doing, making me less willing to want to come back to it.

**4. Focus, Productivity, and Adequate Sleep:** there was a period of time where I tried to be Elon Musk and I didn't sleep very much and used coffee to prop me up. I ended up zoning out in class and conversations, dread whatever it is I have to do first thing in the morning because I hate waking up with an alarm, I get mad or upset easier, the fatigue made me watch a lot of Youtube, and finally I couldn't concentrate nor had nearly as much mental willpower to continue working on hard problems. Staying up late to finish my work perpetuates this cycle. This occured for an entire semester and I ended up with acne all over my face as well; needless to say it was my least functioning semester ever. Anywho, turns out I'm not built like Musk at all, as with most people. I've experimented and learned now that sleep helps me to be 10x more productive the next day: sustained focus, good mood, creativity, less social media time, and mental clarity. I've attached the tips on how to get good sleep below.

**5. Never lose momentum:** The most successful projects or periods I've had were when I've worked on the same project a little bit every day, or at minimum once a week. Once you drop the ball, it is extremely hard to pick it back up again. Also keeping an average person's forgetting curve in mind, when you stop working on something it is very effortful to try to remember back all the context, details, and information required to get something done again. Also, when you always have this project fresh in your mind, you tend to think about it even when you're not workign on it. For example, when writing an article, I walk around or do random unrelated things and sometimes a new idea or perspective pops in my head and I jot it down; I essentially contribute to the article throughout a period of time, and never in one sitting. In group projects, recurring meetings or updates are essential for moving the project forward, keeping everyone on the same page, and keeping people accountable for what they said they'd do the previous week.

**6. Break the procrastination habit cycle:** Talk to yourself like you would an employee, not a slave: motivating, kind, and fair. Here is the sequence of events that occurs with procrastination and without. Break the cycle and start being kinder to yourself.

## Bonus

**1. Adequate Long Term Planning:** I have a weekly Kanban board for the most important tasks for the week. Working only on tasks that matter in the long run, that move the needle, will propel you towards your dreams. When I don't prioritize, I tend to do a bunch of unimportant busywork.

- Pre-requisite: [Long Term Planning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5paYI2nCarc). This video is the planning system I use: setting a 10 year vision, breaking it down roughly what I have to do every year, breaking it down precisely further quarter by quarter, then by month, by week, then finally I know exactly what I have to do every single day. As long as I get my tasks completed in the granular scale, I know I am headed in the right direction. Of course, a lot of my aspirations are creative so some of the goals are just habits like: "write an hour a day". The future is hard to predict as well, so the granular can be planned closer to the date.

**2. How to Sleep Well:**

1. Live somewhere quiet. Noise makes it harder to fall asleep and may wake you up many times throughout the night. Earplugs, if you can't move or if the noise is your partner.
2. Darken the room. Once you go dark you can’t go back. It allows night owls to sleep in and get enough sleep because it prevents getting woken up prematurely in the morning when the sun makes it into your room. Not to mention that it is easier to fall asleep. Install blackout curtains or an eye mask.
3. Temperature: don’t overheat, it may cause nightmares. 70°F (20°C) seems to be the most comfortable for most people. This varies of course between person, blanket thickness, and choice of pajamas.
4. Exercise during the day helps you fall asleep much faster. It also decreases anxious or negative feelings that keep you awake in the night. The onset of work from home cause a huge decrease in exercise in many people and it really shows in the mental health of individuals. In a work from home world, I have a mini bike underneath my desk to keep me awake and moving like a hamster on its wheel. I have seen incredible experiences and results from people walking on their treadmills underneath their standing desk as well.
5. Calm before bed. Watching or reading intense stories, and working intensely on my projects elevate my heart rate and it tends to keep me wide awake, so I try to avoid that. Instead, have a wind-down activity before bed like playing the piano, reading, taking a bath, or journaling. Listen to meditation before sleeping if your mind is racing. Any ritual you complete before bedtime becomes a cue for bedtime, which will shorten the time it takes to fall asleep.
6. In the afternoon or evening, don’t consume caffeine or alcohol, don’t eat, nap, or exercise. All of keep you from getting to sleep as quick.
7. Have a regular schedule. This will help to fall asleep quicker and ensure that you’re not fatigued in the morning. It also offers better long term health outcomes due to regulating circadian rhythm.
8. Taking melotonin. (However, full disclosure I do not personally take it)
9. Seek out adequate room oxygen levels. This is good for your health in general to maintain sufficient oxygen saturation in your blood. Ensure that there is circulation of air from vents or a cracked open window. Sleep apnea is when you have obstructed breathing and you don’t get enough oxygen when you sleep. The most common treatment is a CPAP machine, a mask you put on when you sleep to aid in breathing. If you often feel daytime sleepiness or have loud snoring, then it is good to get checked. “It is now estimated that 26 percent of adults between the ages of 30 and 70 years have sleep apnea.”

**3. Working in Flow:**

We tend to be far more productive when we get into a state of flow (aka being in the zone). Here's how you get into flow state

1. No distractions: of people, of phone (put it in another room), of notifications (do not disturb mode), of sound (noise cancelling headphones), of impending meetings
2. Calm or lowfi music. Some of my fav lowfis: [romance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdURsDPlMrU), [i will wait for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5m4pUJ9_qc), and a [study with me video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7roE5u2fhk). Or chill song of the week I happen to keep on repeat for hours for example: [dead man walking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBR01ndtids&list=RDuCPjdfCUowg&index=8), [yuyu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RWxqTMgiQ4), and [when i was older](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I4fD49Gbck).
3. Don't be too full. Eating too much means food coma, but it may depend on what you eat.
4. Start the session with a clear goal and some idea of execution to get there.
5. Positive reinforcement throughout the task perhaps because it's somethign you're good at, it's working, you see progress, etc
