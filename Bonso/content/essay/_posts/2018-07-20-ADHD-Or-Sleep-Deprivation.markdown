Lack of sleep antagonizes your day to you. You're feeling like hell, getting up after snoozing the alarm 5 times. It gets you to dread work. It’s what makes you countdown the hours to leave work, as you imagine the softness of your bed and the coziness of your blankets. Lack of sleep is what makes you unable to get quality work out in a full workday, leaving you feeling guilty and anxious.

Lack of sleep is what makes you lose focus in a lecture, zone out. What did the professor just say? Wait why are people laughing, you missed the joke. You wonder if you have ADHD. Why am I always zoning out when people talk? The fatigue it gives you in the back of your mind helps you maintain a 2 minute attention span, 20 tabs open all at once. You got to all the fun tabs during the day. At the end of the day, you close the window with all the useful and educational tabs you were going to get to. A fresh start. It was overwhelming anyway.

You’ve lost context of what the professor is saying. You decide to browse reddit for the remainder of the class. You think about what you’re going to eat for dinner. Why do I still have no boyfriend yet? You think about all the homework you have piled up for you when you get home. Evening comes, you open your books but within 5 minutes you go down a rabbit hole of YouTube videos and that goes until the end of your night.

Lack of sleep is what makes you lose the warm blanket over your emotions that make things seem a bit brighter. You weaken or lose your ability of emotional management. A negative event that happens to you, you’re not able to cope with it as well and you may have a little tantrum or breakdown.

Lack of sleep is the bags under your eyes  The darkness leaves your face a little more hollow. You ignore it when you look in the mirror. That’s fine because you found a really good concealer that matches you skin tone perfectly, you can hide almost all of it when you go out and see friends and potentially guys.

It's what causes you to stay up after a long day of not getting any work done to try to force out a code diff or some work out. It’s this staying up that perpetuates another day in the cycle of sleep deprivation.

You make mistakes because you’re unable to focus on details. You slip up once or twice. Maybe even get into a car accident from losing focus, it is the most common cause of car accidents after all.

New year, new phase. I’m going to wait up at 6am every morning because all the successful people do it! After all, elon musk only seem to get only 5 to 7 hours of sleep anyways, why would I need more than him? A week gone by, you feel and look like hell. A couple months goes by, youre barely managing anything in your life properly now. You’re in a perpetual cycle of putting out the alarms of impending deadlines in your life, you’re permanently fatigue and lack focus, and you just don’t seem to have the time and energy to get a lot of things you want done, done. You’ve been drinking more coffee than ever, and even late into the evening to ensure you stay up and get all the things you didn’t do in the day done. You have a face full of acne.

You say it’s just a bad quarter, you’ll probably pick it up again next time.

You get into reading a bunch of self development and productivity books because a bit of motivation is what you need. You find out all along you just lacked grit and extreme ownership over your circumstances. You take your newfound knowledge, excited, heart pumping, and you just cram two full days of massive productivity from drinking coffee for the first time after quitting again. Finding focus on the top 3 things you need to do in a day. You found that you have spent all your time learning about productivity, when your boyfriend just does his work in the day and enjoy his evenings. How do people just know what to do without having to do all this research?

Days pass and you’re unable to focus on even the 3 things by themselves. The morning after The nights you stay up watching YouTube videos, you are unable to focus on anything for more than 10 minutes. You can’t solve hard problems. You’re reading a lot but nothing is registering.

### Way to sleep better

1. Live somewhere quiet, I should hear no noise from my windows at night. I open a bit of my windows to ensure there is always fresh air I’m breathing. Unless I have the heater on, which should circulate the air anyway.
2. Darken the room. Once you go dark you can’t go back. It allows night owls to sleep in and get their full nights sleep. I’m a night owl and this helped immensely in making me feel refreshed, but also allowing me to fall asleep much faster at night. Install blackout curtains or eye mask.
3. Temperature. Don't overheat, it causes nightmares. 70°F (20°C) seems to be the most comfortable for most people.
4. Exercise during the day helps you fall asleep much faster
5. Calm. Have a wind down activity before bed like playing the piano, reading, taking a bath, or journaling. Listen to a meditation before sleeping if to you're feeling negative emotions or want to quiet the mind.
6. Don't consume caffeine after noon.
7. Don't eat, nap, or exercise late in the evening.
8. Have a regular schedule. This will help falling asleep quicker and ensure you're not fatigue in the morning. Also offers better long term health outcomes due to regulating circadian rhythm.
