Due to my belief that one has a full potential they can reach, I have always been open-minded to opportunities that can help me improve as a person. Naturally, I was curious about how much a person can grow from therapy. I thought there probably wouldn’t be that much to talk about and I’ll just try a couple sessions to see what it’s like; somehow I've filled every session that I've attended.

That got me thinking that I wanted to get to know myself better as well. I wanted to explore how past experiences in my life, namely negative ones, impact who I am today; how it affects my perception of myself and how I interact with the world and others. What if my beliefs held me back? What if my lens of the world were distorted? What if my negative emotions overtook me and ruined my relationships? What if I don’t become the person I could have been?

A year later, I’ve found myself with a much deeper understanding of me. I believe taking time out to reflect on how we are shaped and who we are is crucial to become who we want to be. Is there a disconnection between what you do now what you want? What is your trajectory? Getting a second opinion on the way you think about relationships, self, and life, will get you closer, and teach you to do so sustainably with a healthy mindset.

Is it crazy that I have had so many sessions in such a short time? I do skew more on the obsessive side of things, and I'm thankful for great benefits. But my thoughts were, if not now then when?
50 therapy sessions later, these are the main lessons I’ve learned:


## Personal Therapy

### See reality for what it is 
We often hold [Cognitive Distortions](https://arfamiliesfirst.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cognitive-Distortions.pdf) in our minds, where we see the world through a distortion by our past experiences, fears, anxieties, and negative thoughts. This can make us feel extremely negative and unmotivated, for example if we were very harsh on ourselves. 
[Cognitive behavioral therapy](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610) is examining and correcting your negative thinking or self talk. You use it by reframing your perspective and thoughts by finding evidence that disproves limiting or false beliefs and getting rid of things you tell yourself that are untrue, negative or that simply hold you back. 


### A healthy body is so closely linked to a healthy mind. 
* A good night’s sleep helps me be 10x more productive the next day. Typically you don’t feel the effects of sleep deprivation after one night of bad sleep. But after several is when you start feeling the effects. I don’t set an alarm, I keep my room dark and quiet, and I wake up naturally when I have had enough sleep. Especially doing a job like programming, when I’m not alert it is very hard for me to persist in debugging, think straight, and remember details. I don’t like how common it is right now for people to set multiple alarms to wake up, only to need coffee to prop you up for the rest of the day. Life is much more enjoyable when you don’t have to use all your willpower and force yourself out of bed to commute to work.
* Caffeine increases anxiety. Caffeine also impacts sleep if it is consumed too late in the day. Anxiety is directly linked to a good night’s sleep. What worked for me was to significantly decrease caffeine, because my energy is more consistent and my mood is calmer. 

### Burnout
There were weeks when I experienced burnout. My therapist worked me through it. There are telltale signs that lead up to it. Catching it will help prevent it. However, it is also easier to just work at a sustainable pace and be easy on yourself. Work life balance and self care were once silly matters to me until I’ve experienced burnout. A life balanced with self care also improves mood, creativity, consistency, and productivity. More on burnout [here](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery.htm)

### Everyone is responsible for themselves
Take full responsibility for yourself, your emotions, and your actions. You can’t blame everyone for anything. People act based on their own beliefs, knowledge, past experience, their own incentives, etc. In a world where everyone is their own person, you can’t and shouldn’t force anyone to do anything. You can only make recommendations and decide whether you want to be in a situation or not. Focus on yourself. Take initiative to confront your own insecurities. Hold yourself accountable. Learn to be your own coach: talk to yourself in a truthful and kind way like pushing yourself to reach your goals or to coach yourself to feel better about a situation. Learn to self sooth. 

### Emotional management

People aren't good communicators nor think logically when they're feeling intense emotions. Anger often comes across as normal, but there is actually an art in handling it so that you don’t damage yourself or your relationships. Anger hides other emotions like insecurity, needs not being met, etc, so it is crucial to understand what is the underlying problem. Learn how to recognize the anger is coming before it comes, in the way Jim from The Office looks into the camera when something odd is occuring. Then take a timeout from the conversation. Escalating the conversation will only hurt relationships.

Procrastination happens due to a lack of emotional management, not time management. Sleep helps immensely with emotional management. Prioritizing your top 3 things in a day will help you focus. Build systems that you do daily rather than a seating to finish everything. Retention for learning is better when it's spread throughout multiple sessions. The systems you do daily should align with long term goals. Make sure to seek small wins throughout a project. Positive self-talk gives you more energy to power through a project or task, so avoid getting into situations where you feel guilt, for example putting off the most importnat and anxiety inducing task.

### Untangle the past
Anything that we avoid stays with us. Trauma is any event that has had an impact on us and/or elicits some emotional reaction. Learning more about your past will help you understand why you act the way you do in certain situations or how and why you view the world the way you do. Once you unlearn bad habits you’ve learned from your parents or past relationships, you’re able to process negative events that have happened, realizing that it no longer has power over you. One example is learning how your [attachment style](https://www.attachmentproject.com/blog/four-attachment-styles/), developed in you by your caregivers, impacts your current relationships.

### Resolve problems immediately
Avoiding confrontation or clear communication about something that bothers you will build resentment. Resentment is a ticking bomb. Resolve all that you feel as early as possible. Building resentment over time will end relationships or cause an angry outburst which hurts the relationship. Resentment built up over years can create a ball of anger inside you that will carry over in other areas of your life.
I was very afraid of confrontation. My therapist walked through a conversation I was going to have with someone on an issue that was bothering me for months. She helped me imagine exactly how it would play out, the points I was going to bring up, the questions I had been wondering for a while now and what I wished for the conversation. I replayed the things I wanted to say to the actual person, and I felt incredibly relieved. Having someone guide me through it once, I’ve learned to use it in other areas of my life: to not run away or delay the resolution of problems.

Of course, as with anything in this article, this is one of those things that is easy to say and hear as an advice: don’t run from your problems. But to actually have someone guide you through applying it in your life, when faced with a problem that has bothered you for months, and then finally lifting that weight of your shoulders, it is a completely different feeling. That's why it's important to take or find the right advice at the right time. Perhaps it is also important for some people to get hurt themselves to learn. I don't have an answer for this but I guess this might depend on a person's willingless to learn from the mistakes of others. Or that when it comes to certain things such as love, one must experience and learn it for themselves through experience.


## Relationship therapy
[Link to some relationship concepts and worksheets](https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheets/relationships/none)
Relationship therapy helps move the relationship towards a healthier, happier and more mature relationship. We pick up bad habits throughout our life, from the way our parents communicate with each other and to us, to how our past relationships looked like. Some negative things can and should be unlearned. Couples therapy is also a way to just a great way to reflect and talk about past arguments with a referee in the room. Here is a [checklist for a healthy relationship.](https://debbicarberry.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Healthy-Relationship-Checklist.pdf) 

### Non-violent communication
The point of speaking is so the intended person will hear it and understand you. When one mumbles or speaks at a low volume, the other person will miss half the words. When one speaks in an aggressive or accusatory way, likewise, the other person will not hear the actual intent of the speech because one becomes defensive or upset at the tone or sting of the words, and they can close up. The way you say the same sentence can either be a calm, collaborative conversation or one that triggers the other person to feel attacked, controlled, or vulnerable. Learn to speak in a way that uses [non-violent communication]():
* Forming demands into questions: instead of demanding "take out the trash!", try asking "would you mind taking out the trash?"
* Avoiding generalizations: "you always do this!" 
* Focusing more on how you feel, rather than what the other person did. Instead of shouting "I can't believe you did that! Stop doing that!", say "I don't like it when _____, it makes me feel like I'm not valued".
* Assertive Communication. It is directly telling someone your needs and beliefs, but doing so in a way that respects the other person. Neglecting your own needs builds resentment over time. Overly aggressive communication can lead to damaging the relationship.

A related concept is the [Pursuer-Distancer Pattern](https://accesscm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Pursuer-Distancer-Pattern.pdf), a common pattern in relationships where one likes to withdraw from arguments and the other likes to force communication. 

## Balanced Relationships
In relationships that aren’t balanced, it is easy to burn out as you feel like you are giving so much, but not receiving anything in return. You are holding things in, putting others' needs ahead of your own, when the needs of both parties need to be met in order to sustain a long term relationship. See [list of personal needs in intimate relationships](https://kengcrawford.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/sl-personal-needs-in-intimate-relationships.pdf). A built up of your needs not being met over time can lead to a buildup of resentment or dissatisfaction. Compromise. 

Relationship therapy will help you and your partner to understand each other, improving your communication by learning more about each other and how you two respond to different situations. By understanding each other‘s perspectives and how actions and words may impact the relationship, it becomes easier to come to conclusions, resolve things and make action plans. 
Like training for a new job, relationship therapy is like training to interact with each other.

* Each person has their own ways of showing and feeling loved, see [love languages](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/the-5-love-languages-explained).
* Each person has their own [attachment styles](https://www.attachmentproject.com/blog/four-attachment-styles/), learned from their caregivers. It is useful to read how it impacts how you interact with each other. 
* With feelings of jealousy or distance, focus on strengthening the relationship.
* Remember that individuals need alone sometimes. Take time away from your partner at least once a day - seeing anyone too much usually leads to some friction. 

## Finding the right therapist
Like in any relationship, not everyone will be a good match for you. I’ve tried a number of therapists before I found “the one”. Here are a few things to look for in a therapist:
1. Is unassuming, un-judgemental. Someone that empathize with you and make you realize that what you’re feeling is valid.
2. Encourages you to talk about what is most pressing, what has been bothering you. At the end of the session you feel a resolution or a step towards it. If they feel you haven’t fully resolved the problem, they will send you readings or some homework. They check in the next time you meet to see whether it has been resolved. It’s a world of a difference when you have a therapist that actually provides results and finds the root of the problem compared to someone who provides a lot of surface level recommendations.
3. Makes you feel comfortable. It’s important to feel like you can trust your therapist, so that you’re comfortable telling them everything. Holding things back doesn’t give them the full picture to be able to help you or find the root of the problem. Keep in mind that your therapist only sees what you give them, and advises you accordingly. You could be hiding certain things or communicating it not in the correct way, and they might give you accurate advice, which is why you should try to be as objective as possible. 4. Be vulnerable and answer the questions truthfully
Understands your cultural values (for me, it was crucial that my therapist understands how I view the world through the lens of my culture, how I view my relationship with my parents; someone who understands the type of household I grew up in because they themselves grew up with a similar type of parenting and value systems instilled)
5. Is consistent with their scheduling and is responsible and reliable
6. Finally, a therapist whose practices are grounded in science and on evidence-based treatments

## Self Learning
As with anything, I’m confident you can also learn all of this yourself from the internet, if you don’t have benefits or can’t afford therapy right now. Having a second perspective just helps prevent biases and point out any assumptions you have that aren’t necessarily true, but also point you to the right resources at the right time. Doing it yourself will take a bit longer and requires a great self awareness, but not impossible. I have linked to most of the concepts I’ve talked about throughout, to help get you started. I will always write more about learnings I have found useful in this blog.
There’s a lot of [free worksheets and exercises here](https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheets).


### End
It feels surreal to look back and see how nice it is to untangle the knots of the mind. To see the amount of things I tolerated because it was all I know, and to no longer let it be the status quo. This is just a little over one year in my lifetime of learning. For now, I look forward to seeing who I will be in the future.
