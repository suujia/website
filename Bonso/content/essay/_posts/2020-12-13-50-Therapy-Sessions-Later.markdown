I was curious about how much a person can grow from therapy. I thought that there probably wouldn’t be that much to talk about and that I’d just try a couple sessions to see what it’s like; somehow I filled every session, 50 sessions later.

I wanted to get to know myself better as well. I wanted to explore how past experiences in my life impact who I am today; how it affects my perception of myself and how I interact with the world and others. What if my beliefs held me back? What if my lens of the world was distorted? What if my negative emotions overtook me and ruined my relationships? What if I have biases that hurt other people? How could I be the best person that I could be?

A year or so later, I’ve found myself more calm and with clarity than I’ve ever been. I believe now, that taking time out to reflect on how we were shaped is crucial to becoming who we want to be. What is your trajectory? Getting a second opinion on the way you think about relationships, self, and life, will make everything run more smoothly and happier.

Is it crazy that I have had so many sessions in such a short time? I do skew more on the obsessive side of things so it's the only way I know, and I have excellent benefits. But my thoughts are: if not now, then when? And I'm so glad I did because having gone through it has helped all areas of my life. And I would hate for anyone to avoid it because of any stigma. I am subclinical and working with a therapist has helped me to learned about my present and past self, make better decisions, resolve problems effectively, quiet the mind, interactions optimally with others, and much more. 50 therapy sessions later, these are the main lessons I’ve learned:

## Personal Therapy

### See reality for what it is

We often hold [Cognitive Distortions](https://arfamiliesfirst.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cognitive-Distortions.pdf) in our minds, where we see the world that is distorted by our past experiences, fears, anxieties, and negative thoughts. This can make us feel extremely negative and unmotivated, for example when we are overly harsh on ourselves.
[Cognitive behavioral therapy](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610) is examining and correcting your negative thinking or self talk. You use it by reframing your perspective and thoughts by finding evidence that disproves limiting or false beliefs and getting rid of things you tell yourself that are untrue, negative or that simply hold you back.

### A healthy body is so closely linked to a healthy mind.

- A good night’s sleep helps me be 10x more productive the next day. Typically you don’t feel the effects of sleep deprivation after one night of bad sleep. But after several is when you start feeling the effects. I don’t set an alarm, I keep my room dark and quiet, and I wake up naturally when I have had enough sleep. Especially in a job like programming, when I’m not alert it is very hard for me to persist in debugging, think straight, and remember details. I don’t like how common it is right now for people to set multiple alarms to wake up, only to need coffee to prop you up for the rest of the day. Life is much more enjoyable when you don’t have to use all your willpower and force yourself out of bed to commute to work.
- Caffeine increases anxiety. Caffeine also impacts sleep if it is consumed too late in the day. The amount of daytime anxiety is directly linked to whether or not you had a good night’s sleep. What works for me is to significantly decrease caffeine, as my energy is more consistent and my mood is calmer.

### Burnout

There were weeks when I experienced intense burnout. My therapist worked me through it. There were telltale signs that led up to it. Catching them would help prevent it. However, it is also easier to just work at a sustainable pace and be easy on yourself. Work, life balance and self care were once silly matters to me until I experienced burnout. A life balanced with self care also improves mood, creativity, consistency, and productivity. More on burnout [here](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery.htm)

### Everyone is responsible for themselves

Take full responsibility for yourself, your emotions, and your actions. You can’t constantly blame others for your own misfortunes. People act based on their own beliefs, knowledge, past experience, their own incentives, etc. In a world where everyone is their own person, you can’t and shouldn’t force anyone to do anything. Focus on yourself. Take initiative to confront your own insecurities. Learn to be your own coach to be able to push or soothe yourself.

### Emotional management

People aren't good communicators nor think logically when they're feeling intense emotions. Anger often comes across as normal, but there is actually an art in handling it so that you don’t damage yourself or your relationships. Anger hides other emotions like insecurity, needs not being met, etc, so it is crucial to understand what is the underlying problem. Learn how to recognize that anger is coming before it comes, in the way Jim from The Office looks into the camera when something odd is occuring. Then take a timeout from the conversation. Escalating the conversation will only hurt relationships.

Procrastination happens due to a lack of emotional management, not time management. Sleep helps immensely with emotional management. Prioritizing your top 3 things in a day will help you focus. Build systems that you do daily and have it align with your long term goals. Retention for learning is better when it's spread throughout multiple sessions. Make sure to seek small wins throughout a project. Positive self-talk gives you more energy to power through a project or task, so avoid getting into situations where you feel guilt, for example putting off the most important and anxiety inducing tasks.

### Untangle the past

Anything that we avoid stays with us. Trauma is any event that has had an impact on us and/or elicits some emotional reaction or dictates how we behave in that situation. Learning more about your past will help you understand why you act the way you do in certain situations or how and why you view the world the way you do. It can also help you unlearn bad habits and negative biases that you’ve learned from your parents or past relationships or process negative events that have happened to realize that it no longer has power over you. You can learn to understand how hardships in the past have shaped you, find any remaining loose ends in your mind that needs to be tied up. One example is learning how your [attachment style](https://www.attachmentproject.com/blog/four-attachment-styles/), developed in you by your caregivers, impacts your current relationships.

### Resolve problems immediately

All things trend toward disorder. A task that is being avoided will look more intimidating over time. A conversation you've been avoiding will replay in your mind over and over again. A problem within a team or project that does not get fully solved will appear again and again, until you reach a point where avoiding it is no longer an option.

When you resolve a problem and tie a bow on it, it no longer has power over you. The closure of it will bring you peace. The thought of it won't linger in the back of your mind anymore. You free up it's ability to be pondered about again and again. Most of the time for me anyway, deliberation is just avoidance or time to come up with an excuse to not do it; so just do it. Do the task that causes the biggest anxiety, and make the rest of your day calmer.

I also found out that often times, the decision I was going to make when the problem first came to my attention is the exact same as when I actually end up doing it. I could have shortcut this period of mild agony and stress when I just committed to the decision in the first place. For example with email, replying right way means you don't have to spend time reading and deliberating it again. Context switching also has a cost, while you're in the context of this problem already, just solve it. Only take time and care for the things that really matter.

So tying back to therapy, I was very afraid of confrontation. My therapist walked through a conversation I was going to have with someone on an issue that was bothering me for months. She helped me imagine exactly how it would play out, the points I was going to bring up, the questions I had been wondering for a while now and what I wished for the conversation. I replayed the words in the real scenario with the actual person, and I felt incredibly relieved to resolve it in the end. Having someone guide me through it once, I’ve learned to use it in other areas of my life: to not run away or delay the resolution of my problems.

Taking action immediately will almost always bring more peace.

### [Sidebar]

As with anything in this article, advice is easy to hear but difficult to find relevant and implement; in this case, the lesson is don’t run away from your problems. But when faced with a problem that has been tormenting you for months, to have someone advise you through applying it in your life, and then finally having the weight lifted off your shoulders is a completely different feeling. That’s why it’s important to take or find the right advice at the right time. Perhaps it is also important for some people to get hurt themselves to learn. I don’t have an answer for this but I guess this might depend on a person’s willingness to learn from the mistakes of others. Or that when it comes to certain things such as love, one must experience and learn it for themselves. I guess by exposing you to a variety of concepts I’ve learned, chances are you can at least take 1 thing away from this article: something that’s relevant to you right now.

## Relationships

- [Link to some relationship concepts and worksheets](https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheets/relationships/none)

Relationship therapy helps move the relationship towards a healthier, happier and more mature relationship. We pick up bad habits throughout our life, from the way our parents communicate with each other and to us, to how our past relationships looked like. Some negative things can and should be unlearned. Couples therapy is also just a great way to reflect and talk about past arguments with a referee in the room. However these same principles apply to any relationships are just in general, great interpersonal skills and translate well in all relationships you have.

### Non-violent communication

The point of speaking is so the intended person will hear it and understand you. When one mumbles or speaks at a low volume, the other person will miss half the words. When one speaks in an aggressive or accusatory way, likewise, the other person will not hear the actual intent of the speech because one becomes defensive or upset at the tone or sting of the words, and they can close up. The way you say the same sentence can either be a calm, collaborative conversation or one that triggers the other person to feel attacked, controlled, or vulnerable. Learn to speak in a way that uses [non-violent communication]():

- Forming demands into questions: instead of demanding "take out the trash!", try asking "would you mind taking out the trash?"
- Avoiding overgeneralizations: "you always do this!" or "i never do that"
- Focusing more on how you feel, rather than what the other person did. Instead of shouting "I can't believe you did that!", say "I really don't like it when you **\_**, it makes me feel \_\_\_".
- Focus on how the other person feels and the reasoning behind their actions.
- Knowing that at the end of the day, no one has control or power over anyone else. On top of that, no one can make you feel a certain way if you don't allow it. You choose how you react 

Another related concept is Assertive Communication. It is directly telling someone your needs and beliefs, but doing so in a way that respects the other person. Neglecting your own needs builds resentment over time. Overly aggressive communication can lead to damaging the relationship.
Another related concept is the [Pursuer-Distancer Pattern](https://accesscm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Pursuer-Distancer-Pattern.pdf), a common pattern in relationships where one likes to withdraw from arguments and the other likes to force communication.

## Balanced Relationships

In relationships that aren’t balanced, it is easy to burn out as you feel like you are giving too much, but not receiving anything in return. You are holding things in, putting others' needs ahead of your own, when the needs of both parties need to be met in order to sustain a long term relationship. See [list of personal needs in intimate relationships](https://kengcrawford.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/sl-personal-needs-in-intimate-relationships.pdf). A build up of your needs being unmet over time can lead to a reservoir of resentment or dissatisfaction. This resentment can lead to persistent increased stress and unhappiness when you're with them, cause an angry outburst which hurts the relationship, or get to a point where you want to sever ties with them. This resentment can also create a ball of anger inside you that will carry over into other areas of your life.

If it is a relationship you want to preserve, make your needs known, get to know your partner's needs, and resolve all that you feel as early as possible.

## Understanding Each Other

Relationship therapy will help you and your partner to understand each other, improving your communication by learning more about each other and how you two respond to different situations. By understanding each other‘s perspectives and how actions and words may impact the relationship, it becomes easier to come to conclusions, resolve things and make action plans.

Like training for a new job, relationship therapy is like training to interact with each other.

- Each person has their own ways of showing and feeling loved, see [love languages](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/the-5-love-languages-explained). The 5 types are: acts of service, words of affirmation, gifts, quality time spent together, and touch. Knowing yours and your partners and acting accordingly to make each other feel loved will improve relationship morale dramatically. Even if you think you're showing love, if you are not showing it in the way your partner would prefer/feel loved receiving it, they may not feel it
- Each person has their own [attachment styles](https://www.attachmentproject.com/blog/four-attachment-styles/), learned from their caregivers. It is useful to read how it impacts how you interact with each other. It is shocking how accurately it explains how different attachment styles interact with each other. A great book on this is [Attached](https://www.amazon.com/Attached-Science-Adult-Attachment-YouFind/dp/1585429139/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=attached&qid=1609552197&sr=8-1)
- With feelings of jealousy or distance, focus on strengthening the relationship.
- Individuals need alone time sometimes, seeing anyone too much leads to some friction. Take time away from each other to look forward to seeing each other.

## Finding the right therapist

Like in any relationship, not everyone will be a good match for you. I’ve tried a number of therapists before I found a great one. Here are a few things to look for in a therapist:

1. Is unassuming and un-judgemental. Someone that empathizes with you and makes you realize that what you’re feeling is valid.
2. Encourages you to talk about what is most pressing, what has been bothering you. At the end of the session you feel a resolution or a step towards it. If they feel you haven’t fully resolved the problem, they will send you readings or some homework. They check in the next time you meet to see whether it has been resolved. It’s a world of difference when you have a therapist that actually provides results and finds the root of the problem compared to someone who only provides a lot of surface level recommendations.
3. Makes you feel comfortable. It’s important to feel like you can trust your therapist, so that you’re comfortable telling them everything. Holding things back doesn’t give them the full picture to be able to help you or find the root of the problem. You should try to be as objective as possible. Be vulnerable and answer the questions truthfully.
4. Understands your cultural values (for me, it was crucial that my therapist understands how I view the world through the lens of my culture, how I view my relationship with my parents; someone who understands the type of household I grew up in because they themselves grew up with a similar type of parenting and value systems instilled);
5. Is consistent with their scheduling and is responsible and reliable;
6. Finally, a therapist whose practices are grounded in science and on evidence-based treatments.

## Self Learning

As with anything, I’m confident you can also learn all of this yourself from the internet, if you don’t have benefits or can’t afford therapy right now. Having a second perspective just helps prevent biases and points out any assumptions that you have that aren’t necessarily true, helps to guide you to the right resources at the right time, and provides the emotional support humans need. Doing it yourself will take a bit longer and requires great self awareness, but it’s not impossible. I have provided links to most of the concepts that I’ve talked about throughout, to help get you started. I will also write some more learnings that I have found useful in this blog.
There’s a lot of [free worksheets and exercises here](https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheets).

### End

It feels surreal to look back and see how nice it feels to untangle the knots of the mind. To see the amount of things that I tolerated in the past because it was all that I knew. For now, I’m really looking forward to seeing who I will be in the future.
