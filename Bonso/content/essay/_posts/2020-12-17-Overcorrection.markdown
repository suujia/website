There are certain things that we do or care about more so than the average person. When there is a painful, negative experience, we tend to avoid it as much as possible in our future. However, like a pendulum we overcorrect.

### Examples

    * When you had a bad experience with tequila and decide to avoid it for years
    * If as the youngest child you felt ignored or not heard because your opinion overridden by those older.  In your adulthood you will value being heard a lot
    * In dating, we remember vividly the negative traits in our past partners or parents that have hurt us, and we try very hard to avoid those traits in our future partner. For example, if youâ€™ve been hurt by someone that has lied to you excessively in the past, you become hypersensitive to shady people and actively try to avoid them
    * People that have lost money in the stock market may choose to never invest in stocks again. Risk aversion follows losses. Humans dislike losing
    * If you didn't have much control in the past for example, strict parents, you will seek control in your future
    * If you did poorly in school and it made you feel incompetent, you may try to overcorrect in real life and work

In tracing back to the origins of current our habits or values, we can earn a deeper understanding of ourselves and then change or accept ourselves accordingly. By understanding others this way, we can be more compassionate to them, because we know that they behave or believe in such a way because of their unique past.
