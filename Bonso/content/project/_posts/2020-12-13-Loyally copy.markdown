I've been working on an application for restaurants customer loyalty program. The reason being, I already have my first user signed up: my brother in law. I built their website ([老街小吃](http://oldstreetrestaurant.com/)), used to run their instagram & influencer marketing [Old Street 老街小吃’s (@oldstreetcrepe) profile on Instagram • 69 posts](https://www.instagram.com/oldstreetcrepe/), ran their facebook ads, and have also grabbed a chinese crepe every time I passed his restaurant. Needless to say I am very much invested in their success :)

This was also a great opportunity for me to work build an app in sync with the customer, according to their needs. And to also experiment with customers at the restaurant and see how they interact with it.

And off we go, [Russell](https://rwblickhan.org/about/) and I started pushing code every week. Our technical stack was react native, swift, and postgres.
