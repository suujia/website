<h3 id="way-to-sleep-better">Way to sleep better</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Live somewhere quiet, noise makes it harder to fall asleep and may wake you up many times throughout the night.</li>
  <li>Darken the room. Once you go dark you can‚Äôt go back. It allows night owls to sleep in and get enough sleep because it prevents getting woken up prematurely in the morning when the sun makes it in your room. And it is easier to fall asleep. Install blackout curtains or an eye mask;</li>
  <li>Temperature. Don‚Äôt overheat, it causes nightmares. 70¬∞F (20¬∞C) seems to be the most comfortable for most people. This varies of course between person, blanket thickness, and choice of pyjamas;</li>
  <li>Exercise during the day helps you fall asleep much faster;</li>
  <li>Calm. Have a wind-down activity before bed like playing the piano, reading, taking a bath, or journaling. Listen to meditation before sleeping if you‚Äôre feeling negative emotions or want to quiet the mind;</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt consume caffeine in the afternoon;</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt eat, nap, or exercise late in the evening;</li>
  <li>Have a regular schedule. This will help to fall asleep quicker and ensure you‚Äôre not fatigued in the morning. It also offers better long term health outcomes due to regulating circadian rhythm;</li>
  <li>Having a cue for when it‚Äôs bedtime. Like a bedtime routine of a warm shower, unwinding, reading in bed, etc. This shortens the amount of time it takes to fall asleep.</li>
  <li>Oxygen. This is just good for your health in general to have high oxygen saturation in your blood. Ensure there is circulation of air from vents or a cracked open window will ensure it. Sleep apnea is when you have obstructed breathing and you don‚Äôt get enough oxygen when you sleep. The most common treatment is a CPAP machine that is a mask you put on when you sleep to aid breathing. If you often feel daytime sleepiness or have loud snoring, then it is good to get checked. ‚ÄúIt is now estimated that 26 percent of adults between the ages of 30 and 70 years have sleep apnea,‚Äù (<a href="https://aasm.org/rising-prevalence-of-sleep-apnea-in-u-s-threatens-public-health/#:~:text=It%20is%20now%20estimated%20that,70%20years%20have%20sleep%20apnea.">Source</a>).</li>
