I"ô=<p>What drives the passion in someone to obsess over their work?</p>

<p>I am inconsistent when it comes to things I don‚Äôt want to do, things that don‚Äôt pull me. Leading to me feeling guilty when I‚Äôm not accomplishing what I‚Äôve set out to do. This lowers my confidence in my own competence and perceived conscientiousness.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm someone that is obsessed with optimizing my life and have a long list of goals. However I‚Äôm always feeling drained at the end of forcing myself to work for a period on a project I despise. Working on something you dislike or hanging around people you dislike drains your energy. Leaving you needing to cope with a break or avoidance. The thoughts of this project alone can fill me with anxiety, making me not want to complete it even more. Procrastination of not wanting to do it leaves me with more anxiety when I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs not complete yet.</p>

<p>Turns out, doing things I enjoy gives me way more hours in a day. I‚Äôm able to maintain a good mood that carries me from task to task. I‚Äôm able to sustain a focus on things I enjoy much more. I‚Äôm able to start on a task much quicker, as opposed to dreading projects and having to do a whole ritual before starting a task: cleaning my room, watching a few motivational youtube videos, journaling positive self talk, and meditating before the dreadful thing I do not want to do. My regular rain dance to try to summon motivation to work on something that never aligned with me in the first place. Yes, maybe I am just really dramatic and a whole lot less compliant than average.</p>

<p>I can go through life forcing myself to do things, regularly not having enough willpower to push myself to do it because it‚Äôs not something I want to do. Or I can choose to add a fun component. After all, the stakes are high. I have a lot of goals I‚Äôm dying to complete. I want to optimize myself in every way possible. I had to look internally and do a reorg on my life.</p>

<p>Therefore, this past few months I have to gamify my life and decided to pounce on the things that I‚Äôm extremely interested in. I‚Äôve summarized a few key lessons I‚Äôve used to make things I consider productive more interesting in my life, so that I can increase the amount that I do in the things I choose. This new system allows me to be pulled by the things I work on, rather than having to push myself up a hill. Being excited to work on your next todo item is truly great for wellbeing. You exert very little willpower to do so.</p>

<p>We tend to associate positive or negative feelings towards a task, place, person, etc.  If a friend makes you laugh until your stomach hurts, you‚Äôre far more likely to want to hang out with them again. When we have historically stressed out a lot and forced to play the piano, we may be avoidant of it, in fear of the negative emotions it may bring once again. Therefore, simply put: <em>**</em>we want to make positive habits more positive or less negative to make them easier to want to do.</p>

<h3 id="turn-healthy-and-productive-habits-into-fun">Turn healthy and productive habits into fun</h3>

<p>When you enjoy something, you can‚Äôt believe how fast the day flew by.</p>

<p><strong>Replace it with a more fun alternative:</strong> I‚Äôve tried to get myself to go to the gym or jogging for years. I‚Äôd be extremely inconsistent because I dread it and it is not something I enjoy doing. Despite the positive feelings I have after a session, it is not enough of a positive experience to keep me wanting to go back. This quarantine season I‚Äôve completed my daily physical activity through tennis. It‚Äôs extremely fun and competitive, it is really good exercise, and it‚Äôs social. It‚Äôs fun throughout the game and it‚Äôs fun afterwards when you try to strategize on how to improve or feel great if you won the game.</p>

<p>Even in learning piano, I have turned it way more fun by instead of playing songs from the piano lessons book, I started looking up the music sheets of my favourite songs and singing along. Just this shift alone of enjoying the music way more, has allowed me to spend way more time playing the piano then I otherwise would have.</p>

<p><strong>Make it humorous</strong>: Education with a humorous teacher (Trevor Noah using humor to present news). Using humor in tough times to frame the scenario in a more positive light. Humor laced into my psychology professor in university kept everyone in the class engaged</p>

<p><strong>Make it social:</strong> Instead of studying alone, or study with other people. socializing with others has been shown to decrease stress for being more resilient (Citation). Going to exercise with someone else.</p>

<p><strong>Make it comfortable:</strong> Ensure you‚Äôre rewarded throughout the task by enjoying the process. Making your study space so comfortable and enjoyable by adding with a beverage that you like. Calm. Bring the healthy snacks. Getting a second monitor</p>

<p>Painting and doing things with your hands like closet organization brings a lot of calm</p>

<p><strong>Start the Momentum ‚Üí</strong> momentum keeps people continuing. It is easier to continue a task than to start a task. Success is motivating. I am forgetting small wins that will carry you to the next task and the next task. This is popular in software engineering when planning sprints. It‚Äôs basically working in periods of two weeks to break down a large software project into manageable chunks, prioritizing the most important tasks every sprint and doing it in descending order of importance, allocating tasks to the best person on the team to complete them, and at the end of it all having a review of how to sprint went and demos. This ensures that every two weeks you can see progress made and the team can celebrate and start planning the next sprint, adjusting resources and new sprint accordingly from current learnings.</p>

<p><strong>Build confidence by doing</strong> ‚Üí  Our perception of how something is going to go, dictates our willingness to do it or attend it.</p>

<p><strong>Make it align with your passions or goals:</strong> Work on projects you truly truly enjoy and want to see the outcome of. While you enjoy the process. You will work five times harder but not notice it because you enjoy it and are able to give it your complete focus. When you find something intriguing and fun, you‚Äôll spend way more time engaged in the activity. You‚Äôre curious about it and will be compelled to research more or work on it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If something is the next logical step in your career or personal life, take it.</li>
  <li>Not everything can be fun. But everything you do can have a strong reason for you to do it, and it aligns with your long term goals. This is <a href="https://conradlin.com/blog/posts/achieve-your-goals/">the system I use to establish long term goals</a> and align everything I need to get there.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Perfect balance of attainable vs challenging keeps you engaged</strong> ‚Üí</p>

<p>When it is too difficult you may give up before we even try because the path is uncertain and the results are not guaranteed. When it is too easy you‚Äôre not engaged throughout it. We appreciate things more if it took a little difficulty to obtain. That‚Äôs when we feel the sense of accomplishment.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When it is too difficult/overwhelming</strong>: If it is impossible in your mind to do it, you would not know where to start. Breaking it down into step by step and knocking each step out. This will ensure you are getting small wins along the way which builds momentum. Don‚Äôt think about it from the perspective of master and slave where you have to sit down and have to do something to completion. Focus on the inputs and outputs will naturally follow. The inputs would be spent two hours on The draft of your essay rather than have a perfect A+ essay right now.
    <ul>
      <li>Learning how to code is really about aiming for small chunks, getting every line to work before moving on to the next section. Validating every logic to ensure it works as you expect in all scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>When it is too easy:</strong> find ways to make something more interesting. Try to find a new way of doing something or a new path to take. Look at it from a different perspective or go more in depth. Ask yourself what is the next level up from this? Can you do it in a better than you did in the past?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rewarding-good-habits-indirectly-related-to-task-follows-the-task">Rewarding good habits (indirectly related to task) follows the task</h3>

<p>If you can‚Äôt seem to find a fun replacement or make the task more fun, you can still get positive emotions after the task. When you associate positive rewards to this task, you will trick yourself into expecting a reward when completing this task.  <em>**</em></p>

<p><strong>Focus on winning. Start with small wins.</strong> When you only prioritize the most important three tasks of the day, when you have achieved them you can celebrate the wins. You may not actually have to work harder, you are just prioritizing important things rather than things that seem important because it‚Äôs urgent. Even without external rewards, this is almost a freebie where you use your own successes against yourself. A mind that is telling you otherwise, you can bring up evidence that show you actually are making progress and you are doing great things. Align your mind with reality. Cognitive distortions are when your perception deviates from reality and it may bring you down, but it can be corrected.</p>

<p>In competitive people especially, the power of feeling like you‚Äôre winning and the confidence you get from the accomplishments itself is enough for you to push extremely hard towards your goal. Winning comes with money, status, power, confidence (a surge of testosterone) etc.</p>

<p>However, I believe you can artificially create that rewarding feeling, to incentivize you to do more or work harder. I‚Äôve gamified my life by earning points every time I complete a task. Rewarding yourself after a task can be about taking a break, grabbing a snack, checking it off your to do list to feel Accomplished, actually rewarding yourself after a day of studying with some bubble tea. The key thing is that you put the reward after the the hard work.</p>

<p><strong>Rewarding</strong> yourself after a task (Crossing it off your to do list, feeling accomplished, taking a break, grabbing a snack, any activity you enjoy)</p>

<p><strong>Incentives</strong> have been driving individuals throughout the age of time in the game of capitalism or any societal structure. A status and monetary increase in a promotion makes you work harder than you otherwise would, and perhaps become more political. Capitalism is a game of incentives where individuals consume the best product available to them and they vote with your dollars, and companies are creating products that would sell the best. When you set up a system like this, you got everyone playing the game.</p>

<p><strong>You have to trust the process will get you the outcome.</strong> A lack of trust in the process will make you not even try in the first place. That‚Äôs why it helps to work backwards from the goal. If you want to be able to play piano well, you make a plan for what you want to do to get there. I generally search online for the step-by-step guide to getting to the place I want to get to, either this has been about job search or learning a new skill. Forums and individuals sharing their story really has changed my life because it allows me to see what is possible and exactly the steps of how to get there. ‚Üí The recent marshmallow test has been debunked. This is a well-known psychological study that shows A correlation between a child‚Äôs ability to wait And eat the marshmallow and years later having better grades and successful outcomes metrics. Turns out to other things affects this study immensely: this depended heavily on a child‚Äôs trust on the adult telling them to wait would actually give them an additional marshmallow later and The study skewed towards those with food hungry backgrounds (citations). ‚Üí therefore it is critical that you trust the process, and to do that you try to get more information of exactly how to do something.</p>

<p><strong>Accountability</strong> from a mentor or an accountability partner. Positive feeling that you have accomplished it or avoidance of being a disappointment/failure to the other person if you haven‚Äôt accomplished it. It‚Äôs gratifying to talk about the progress you‚Äôve made since you‚Äôve last talked to them.</p>

<p><strong>How does compliance fit into the picture?</strong> It seems highly compliant people may get more joy from ___. However things that make a person more compliant is: authority figure (obedience), social pressure from the group (conformity), and going along with the demand or request (compliance).</p>

<p>‚ÄúConformity to group norms is driven by two motivations, the desire to fit in and be liked and the desire to be accurate and gain information from the group.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="remove-stressors-roadblocks-and-deterrents">Remove stressors, roadblocks, and deterrents</h3>

<p>When their discomfort it lowers the bar in which you need and excuse to stop working on it</p>

<p>When you see value in something, you‚Äôll pursue it and complete it. Always ask yourself while you‚Äôre doing a task or project. Think higher level. If there is no good reason for it don‚Äôt do it. If it Aligns with one of your goals for the long term then you‚Äôll realize that and be reinforced to be more motivated and do it</p>

<p>Remove stressors from a task. Don‚Äôt overthink it and just do it.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt be a dictator that cracks the whip. The slave inside you will rebel and go on strike.</p>

<p>Cut the time between thinking about it to doing it because that time makes the task become larger and more intimidating and more stressful</p>

<p>Make it less overwhelming ‚Äî prioritize. Focus on one thing at a time, Forget the rest of the world. Break the number of steps down to very small steps and write it out, then write out or link the corresponding instructions for how to complete it.</p>

<p>Make you less likely to be distracted from it</p>

<p>Make it asynchronous</p>

<p>Make it less stressful</p>

<p><strong>Prevention</strong> ‚Üí plan ahead and expect any roadblocks.  Decrease the Number of chances you might stop working on the task at hand and do some thing else.</p>

<p>Remove any discomforts: we turn to seek a break for turn to snacking for example when we are feeling fatigue, loneliness, stress, boredom. Getting enough sleep, focussing on one thing at a time, are all things that decreases discomforts. When you go to sleep you don‚Äôt pick up your phone as much for distraction.</p>
