<h3 id="way-to-sleep-better">Way to sleep better</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Live somewhere quiet, I should hear no noise from my windows at night. I open a bit of my windows to ensure there is always fresh air Iâ€™m breathing. Unless I have the heater on, which should circulate the air anyway.</li>
  <li>Darken the room. Once you go dark you canâ€™t go back. It allows night owls to sleep in and get their full nights sleep. Iâ€™m a night owl and this helped immensely in making me feel refreshed, but also allowing me to fall asleep much faster at night. Install blackout curtains or eye mask.</li>
  <li>Temperature. Donâ€™t overheat, it causes nightmares. 70Â°F (20Â°C) seems to be the most comfortable for most people.</li>
  <li>Exercise during the day helps you fall asleep much faster</li>
  <li>Calm. Have a wind down activity before bed like playing the piano, reading, taking a bath, or journaling. Listen to a meditation before sleeping if to youâ€™re feeling negative emotions or want to quiet the mind.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t consume caffeine after noon.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t eat, nap, or exercise late in the evening.</li>
  <li>Have a regular schedule. This will help falling asleep quicker and ensure youâ€™re not fatigue in the morning. Also offers better long term health outcomes due to regulating circadian rhythm.</li>
