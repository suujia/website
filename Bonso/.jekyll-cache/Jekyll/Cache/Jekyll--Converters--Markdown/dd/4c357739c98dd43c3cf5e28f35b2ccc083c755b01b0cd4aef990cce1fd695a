I"]<p>So far I have worked with my music producer and have about 8 songs. A couple of them I have completed lyrics for and have recorded a draft. This has been my most fulfilling and captivating hobby project yet. I really never thought itâ€™d get this far but things change, and change can happen quickly when you devote a lot of attention to it.</p>
